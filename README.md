An implimentation of SRGAN per: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802>
    > Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network

Requirements:
- Pytorch <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>

Data:
- This case study was trained using <tiny-imagenet-200> as opposed to the full ImageNet of the original paper.

Usage:
- Apply your configuration in the ./src/config.yaml
- py ./src/srgan_training.py

Todo:
- Build out backend API

Future Considerations:
- Super-Resolving Images : https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12961
- Hybrid Attention Separable Network for Super Resolution: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09844

Usage Guide:
- Coming Soon!
