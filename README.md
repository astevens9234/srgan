Image upscaler using SRGAN 
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802

TODO:
- Build out SRGAN (wip)
- Light training on toy dataset
- Production training during super-offpeak hours.
- Build out backend in FastAPI
- Decide between localhost & kubernetes deployment.
    - Containerize
    - Deploy on cluster (?) 
        - ^ test performance on CPU first, might be better to localhost w/ my GPU.

Future Considerations:
- Super-Resolving Images : https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12961
- Hybrid Attention Separable Network for Super Resolution: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09844

Usage Guide:
- Coming Soon!
